## How to Find Your SteamID64

### Method 1: Using SteamID.io (Easiest)
1. Go to [SteamID.io](https://steamid.io/lookup)
2. Enter your Steam username or profile URL
3. Copy the **SteamID64** (the long number)

### Method 2: From Your Steam Profile
1. Go to your Steam profile page
2. Right-click on your profile and select "Copy Page URL"
3. The URL will look like: `https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012345678/`
4. The number at the end is your SteamID64: `76561198012345678`

### Method 3: From Steam Client
1. Open Steam
2. Go to your profile
3. Click "Edit Profile"
4. Look for "Steam ID" in the profile settings

## Usage

### Initial Setup (Online Mode)
1. **Start the app** by running `streamlit run cached_app.py`
2. **Click "⚙️ Setup & Configuration"** to expand the setup section
3. **Select "Online Mode"** to fetch fresh data
4. **Enter your Steam API key** (from the steps above)
5. **Enter your SteamID64** (from the steps above)
6. **Click "🔄 Fetch Fresh Data"** to load your game library
7. **Optionally click "📥 Download All Game Details"** to cache detailed information for offline use

### Optional: Use a .env File for Credentials

For easier and more secure local use, you can create a `.env` file in your project folder:

```
STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key_here
STEAM_ID64=your_steamid64_here
```

- The app will automatically load these values and pre-fill the input fields.

- You can still edit the fields in the app if you want to use different credentials.
